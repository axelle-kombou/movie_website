<p><b>Movie_website</b> is a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer. It is made of python files storing a list of my favourite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. </p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
This project was created using python 2.7. When opening the project make sure to have all three files (entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py) saved in the same directory. The main file to run is entertainment.py
